                    <h2>What is Aeronautics Club?</h2>
                    <p>The CDO Aeronautics Club offers students the opportunity to explore the world of aerospace through hands-on activities like building and launching model rockets, flying drones, and capturing aerial photography at school events. We also support members in earning certifications in drone operation and other aviation-related fields, providing a pathway to real-world skills and careers in aviation. Join us to reach new heights!</p>

                    <h2>What do we do at Aeronautics Club?</h2>
                    <p>At CDO Aeronautics Club, we engage in exciting hands-on aerospace projects. Recently, we captured aerial photography for a school football game, giving us a unique perspective of the action from the skies. Currently, we're working on designing a thrust vector control (TVC) model rocket, a project aimed at improving rocket stability and control during flight. Our activities not only give students practical experience but also encourage innovation and exploration in aeronautics.</p>
